# Django Tutorial: Polls App

## To run the app:
<code>py manage.py runserver</code>

## To run the test cases:
<code>py manage.py test polls</code>

## To interact with polls using cli:
<code>py manage.py shell</code>

## To interact with Django-admin:
1. Create a superuser by running this command in your terminal window: <code>python manage.py createsuperuser</code>. This will open an interactive prompt where you can enter the username, email address and password for the new user account. You should then save and exit from the interactive prompt once you have entered all of the required information about the new user account. Once you have created a superuser account in your Django project using this method, you can use that newly-created superuser account to interact with any part of your Django project via its web interface or by interacting directly with it through its command line.
2. Goto: https://localhost:8000/admin.
3. Login as admin user created in Step 1 above.
